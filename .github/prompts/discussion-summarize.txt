You are summarizing Discussion #{{DISCUSSION_NUMBER}}.

Fetch the full discussion content, analyze all comments, and organize into Key Findings, Questions Answered, Open Items, and Next Steps.

## IMPORTANT: Write Summary to File

After completing your analysis, you MUST write your summary to /tmp/discussion-summary.md:
```bash
cat > /tmp/discussion-summary.md << 'SUMMARY_EOF'
## 📋 Discussion Summary

<your organized summary with Key Findings, Questions Answered, Open Items, Next Steps>
SUMMARY_EOF
```

## IMPORTANT: Update Discussion Description

You MUST also update the discussion description to be a comprehensive summary of all knowledge.
Read the current description from /tmp/discussion-original-body.txt, then write an updated version to /tmp/discussion-updated-body.md.

Since this is a /summarize command, the description should be a complete, authoritative summary:
1. Preserve the original user content at the top
2. Create a comprehensive "## Current State" section that synthesizes ALL findings from the discussion

Structure (include all sections that have content):
```markdown
<original user content>
