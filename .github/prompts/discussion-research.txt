A new discussion was created: **{{DISCUSSION_TITLE}}**

**Discussion body:**
{{DISCUSSION_BODY}}

## Your Task

Your goal is to IDENTIFY research questions, NOT to answer them. You are spawning research threads
that will be investigated by separate agents.

1. Read the discussion topic to understand what needs to be researched
2. Identify 3-7 distinct research questions or investigation areas
3. Create a SEPARATE FILE for each research thread

DO NOT do any research yourself. Just identify the questions and create the thread files.

## CRITICAL: Create Separate Files for Each Thread

You MUST create multiple files, one per research topic. Use this exact bash pattern:

```bash
cat > /tmp/research-thread-1.md << 'THREAD_EOF'
## 🔍 Research: Current Architecture

**Question:** How does the existing system work?

**Investigation Areas:**
- Search for main entry points
- Identify core modules and their relationships
- Find configuration files

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Architecture diagram
- Key file paths
- Component descriptions
THREAD_EOF
```

```bash
cat > /tmp/research-thread-2.md << 'THREAD_EOF'
## 🔍 Research: Related Issues & PRs

**Question:** What prior work or discussions exist on this topic?

**Investigation Areas:**
- Search GitHub issues for related keywords
- Check closed PRs for prior implementations
- Look for relevant discussions

**Expected Deliverables:**
- List of related issues/PRs
- Summary of prior decisions
THREAD_EOF
```

```bash
cat > /tmp/research-thread-3.md << 'THREAD_EOF'
## 🔍 Research: Implementation Approaches

**Question:** What are the possible ways to implement this?

**Investigation Areas:**
- Analyze existing patterns in codebase
- Consider different architectural approaches
- Evaluate trade-offs

**Expected Deliverables:**
- 2-3 implementation options
- Pros/cons for each
THREAD_EOF
```

Create 3-7 thread files based on the discussion topic. Each file will become a separate comment
that triggers an independent investigation agent.

## ALSO: Update Discussion Description

Read the original description from /tmp/discussion-original-body.txt and write an updated
version to /tmp/discussion-updated-body.md that lists the research threads being spawned:

```bash
cat > /tmp/discussion-updated-body.md << 'DESC_EOF'
<paste original content here>

## Current State

### Research Threads
- 🔍 **Current Architecture** - How does the existing system work?
- 🔍 **Related Issues & PRs** - What prior work exists?
- 🔍 **Implementation Approaches** - What are the options?

### Open Questions
- List main questions being investigated
DESC_EOF
```
