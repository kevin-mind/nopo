## Step 1: View the Changes

You are already checked out on the PR branch. To see changes:
```bash
git fetch origin main
git diff origin/main...HEAD           # Full diff
git diff origin/main...HEAD --stat    # Summary of changed files
```

## Step 2: Check Existing Review Comments

Check for existing review comments using:
```bash
gh pr view {{PR_NUMBER}} --comments
```

For unresolved comment threads, decide if they should be resolved:
- If the conversation is COMPLETE: Note it can be resolved
- If changes were requested and made: Verify the fix
- If more discussion needed: Leave unresolved

## Step 3: Review the Code

Read the changed files and perform a thorough review:
- Code quality and best practices
- Potential bugs or edge cases
- Test coverage adequacy
- Security considerations

### CRITICAL: Edge Case Testing

Don't just check if todos are addressed - verify the LOGIC is correct:

1. **Trace through with examples**: Pick 2-3 realistic inputs and mentally
   trace the code path. For example:
   - What happens with empty input?
   - What happens with the most common case?
   - What happens at boundaries (first item, last item, max values)?

2. **Test conflicting requirements**: If the feature has multiple options
   (e.g., flags, filters), what happens when they interact?

3. **Run the code if possible**: Use the CLI or test commands to verify
   the feature actually works as intended, not just that it compiles.

4. **Check for design flaws**: Does the implementation order of operations
   make sense? Are filters applied at the right time?

If you find a logic bug, request changes with a specific example showing
the incorrect behavior.
