The CI build failed for PR #{{PR_NUMBER}} on branch {{HEAD_BRANCH}}.

This is a human-created PR, so DO NOT push any changes directly.

Instead:
1. Analyze the project to understand the build and test process (see CLAUDE.md).
2. Run `make check` and `make test` to reproduce the failure.
3. Identify the root cause of the failure.
4. Submit a PR review with your findings and suggestions.

## IMPORTANT: Always Post Visible Feedback

You MUST submit a PR review with your analysis. Use one of:
```
# If you have specific fix suggestions:
gh pr review {{PR_NUMBER}} --comment --body "## CI Failure Analysis

**Root Cause:** <description>

**Suggested Fixes:**
<specific code suggestions with file paths and line numbers>"

# For inline comments on specific files/lines:
gh api repos/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY/pulls/{{PR_NUMBER}}/comments \
  -f body="suggestion" -f path="file.ts" -f line=42 -f side="RIGHT"
```

NEVER leave the PR without feedback - even if you can't identify the exact issue,
post what you found and any partial analysis.

Be helpful and specific - the human author should be able to easily apply your suggestions.
