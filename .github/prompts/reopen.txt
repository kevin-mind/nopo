You are analyzing a reopened issue #{{ISSUE_NUMBER}}: "{{ISSUE_TITLE}}"

Issue body:
{{ISSUE_BODY}}

## Your Tasks

### 1. RESEARCH WHY THE FIX MAY HAVE FAILED
- Look at the linked PR(s) that were supposed to fix this issue
- Review the implementation to understand what was changed
- Identify potential gaps or edge cases that weren't covered
- Check if there are related issues or recent changes that might have caused a regression

```bash
# Find PRs that reference this issue
gh pr list --state all --search "Fixes #{{ISSUE_NUMBER}} OR Closes #{{ISSUE_NUMBER}} OR Resolves #{{ISSUE_NUMBER}}" --json number,title,mergedAt,url

# View the most recent fix PR
gh pr view <pr_number> --json body,files,additions,deletions

# Check recent commits to affected files
git log --oneline -10 -- <affected_files>
```

### 2. UPDATE THE ISSUE DESCRIPTION
Add a new section to the issue body that documents:
- What was tried before (the previous fix)
- Why it likely didn't work (your analysis)
- What should be investigated next

Use this format to prepend the new section:

```bash
gh issue edit {{ISSUE_NUMBER}} --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
