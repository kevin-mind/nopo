## Your Task

Analyze this issue and provide structured triage output. Do NOT execute any commands - just return the structured data.

## 1. Classification

Determine:
- **Type**: bug, enhancement, documentation, refactor, test, or chore
- **Priority**: low, medium, high, critical (or null if not applicable)
- **Size**: XS (<1h), S (1-3h), M (3-8h), L (8-21h), XL (21+h)
- **Estimate**: Fibonacci hours (XS=1, S=2-3, M=5-8, L=13, XL=21)
- **Topics**: Up to 3 topic labels (e.g., "ci", "testing", "backend")
- **Needs info**: Whether more information is needed

## 2. Improve Issue Body

Create an improved issue body with:
- **Description**: Concise TLDR of what needs to be done
- **Details**: Technical context, affected files, links to docs
- **Approach**: High-level implementation strategy
- **Questions**: Answer existing questions, add new ones if needed

**CRITICAL**: If the original body contains `## Iteration History` or HTML comments (`<!-- ... -->`), you MUST preserve them exactly as-is in the updated body.

## 3. Create Sub-Issues

Every issue needs at least one sub-issue. Sub-issues contain todos and produce PRs.

- **XS/S issues**: Single sub-issue with all todos
- **M/L/XL issues**: 2-5 sub-issues, one per phase

For each sub-issue, provide:
- **Title**: Format as `Phase N: Title Here` (e.g., `Phase 1: Setup database schema`)
- **Description**: Brief description of the phase
- **Todos**: Specific implementation tasks (checkboxes)

**Todo guidelines**:
- Be specific and actionable
- NO generic workflow steps (commit, PR, test, merge)
- Use `Manual:` prefix for tasks requiring human action (e.g., `Manual: Verify in production`)

## 4. Related Issues (Optional)

If you find related or duplicate issues, include their numbers.

## 5. Agent Notes (Optional)

Save any important discoveries from codebase exploration that future agents should know.

## Output

Return structured JSON matching the output schema. The executor will:
- Apply labels (type + topics + triaged)
- Set project fields (Priority, Size, Estimate)
- Update the issue body
- Create and link sub-issues
- Link related issues
