## Instructions

This is iteration {{ITERATION}} of the implementation loop. Your goal: make **incremental progress** toward completing the **current phase**. **Do NOT try to complete everything at once.**

### CRITICAL: Phase-Based Implementation

Issues are organized into **phases** (e.g., `## Phase 1: Setup`, `## Phase 2: Core`). Each phase ships as a **separate PR**.

**You must ONLY work on the CURRENT PHASE (Phase {{CURRENT_PHASE}}).** Do NOT work on later phases until the current phase is merged.

Each iteration should:
- Complete **ONE small, focused change** from the current phase's todos
- **Verify locally using nopo commands** before pushing
- Let CI run and trigger the next iteration

When **all todos in the current phase are done** and CI passes:
- The workflow will mark the PR ready for review
- Iteration will **STOP and wait for PR merge**
- After merge, iteration resumes with the next phase

### 1. Understand Current State

First, analyze:
- `git status` and `git log -3` to see branch state
- Previous CI result above (if any)
- Which todos in **Phase {{CURRENT_PHASE}}** are checked vs unchecked
- **IGNORE todos in other phases** - they are for future PRs

### 2. Determine What to Do

**If previous CI failed (LAST_CI_RESULT = failure)**:
- Focus on fixing the CI errors first
- Run `make check` and `make test` to reproduce the failure locally
- Fix the issues, verify locally, then commit

**If previous CI passed OR this is the first iteration**:
- Look at **Phase {{CURRENT_PHASE}} ONLY**
- Pick the **next single unchecked Todo item** in that phase
- Focus on completing **just that one item**
- Do NOT work on todos from other phases

**If all Phase {{CURRENT_PHASE}} todos are done and CI passed**:
- Verify all requirements for THIS PHASE are met
- Ensure tests exist and pass
- The workflow will handle marking the phase complete and requesting review
- **DO NOT start working on the next phase** - wait for PR merge

### 3. Implementation Guidelines

1. **Read each file before editing** - the Edit tool requires this
2. **If an edit fails, re-read the file** - it may already be modified
3. **Never repeat a failed edit** - if text not found, the change is likely done
4. Follow CLAUDE.md guidelines strictly
5. Keep changes **small and focused** - one logical change per iteration

### 4. Verify Locally BEFORE Committing (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS run these commands before committing and after each significant code change:**
```bash
make check    # Lint + type check all code
make test     # Run all tests
make fix      # Auto-fix formatting issues (also runs on pre-commit hook)
```

**STOP AND FIX if any command fails.** Do NOT commit broken code.

**Workflow:**
1. Make your code change
2. Run `make check` - fix any errors
3. Run `make test` - fix any failures
4. Then commit (pre-commit hook runs `make fix` automatically)
5. Push only after local verification passes

This is critical because:
- CI failures waste time and iteration count
- Local verification catches issues faster
- Each failed CI counts toward the retry limit (max 5)
- The pre-commit hook will run `make fix` automatically

### 5. Update Todo Progress (Current Phase Only)

After completing a Todo item **in the current phase**, update the issue body to check it off:

```bash
# Read current issue body, update the checkbox, and save
gh issue view {{ISSUE_NUMBER}} --json body -q '.body' > /tmp/issue_body.md
# Edit /tmp/issue_body.md to change `- [ ] <item>` to `- [x] <item>`
# ONLY check off items in Phase {{CURRENT_PHASE}}
gh issue edit {{ISSUE_NUMBER}} --body-file /tmp/issue_body.md
```

This helps track progress and shows what's been accomplished in the current phase.

### 6. Commit and Push

- Commit with a descriptive message referencing the issue
- Push to origin
- The workflow will handle the rest (CI, next iteration trigger)

### 7. Create PR (First Iteration Only)

If no PR exists yet:
```bash
gh pr create --draft --reviewer nopo-bot \
  --title "{{ISSUE_TITLE}}" \
  --body "Fixes #{{ISSUE_NUMBER}}"
```

## Important Notes

- **ONLY work on Phase {{CURRENT_PHASE}}** - ignore todos in other phases
- Focus on ONE logical change per iteration within the current phase
- The workflow will automatically trigger the next iteration after CI completes
- You do NOT need to update the iteration state block - the workflow handles it
- **DO update Todo checkboxes** after completing each item (see section 5)
- `make check` and `make test` are mandatory verification steps, NOT separate Todo items
- When current phase is complete: iteration STOPS, PR goes to review, wait for merge
- After PR merge: iteration resumes automatically with the next phase
- If you're blocked and can't make progress, commit a comment explaining why
- If you notice conflicts with other open PRs, note them in the PR description
