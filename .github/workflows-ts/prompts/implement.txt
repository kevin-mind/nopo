Implement issue #{{ISSUE_NUMBER}}: "{{ISSUE_TITLE}}"

{{ISSUE_BODY}}

You are on branch `{{BRANCH_NAME}}`.

## Instructions

1. Follow CLAUDE.md guidelines strictly
2. **FIRST: Run `git status` and `git log -3` to understand current branch state**
3. **Read each file before editing** - the Edit tool requires this
4. **If an edit fails, re-read the file** - it may already be modified
5. **Never repeat a failed edit** - if text not found, the change is likely done
6. Address Todo items that haven't been completed yet
7. Run `make check` and `make test` - fix any failures
8. Commit with a descriptive message
9. Push to origin
10. Create DRAFT PR with `gh pr create --draft --reviewer nopo-bot`
    - Body MUST contain "Fixes #{{ISSUE_NUMBER}}"
