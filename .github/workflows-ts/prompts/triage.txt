## Your Tasks

### 1. ADD LABELS

#### Type Labels
Add ONE type label based on issue category:
- 'bug', 'enhancement', 'documentation', 'refactor', 'test', 'chore'

#### Priority Labels
Extract the priority from the issue body's "### Priority" section and add the corresponding label:
- Low → `priority:low`
- Medium → `priority:medium`
- High → `priority:high`
- Critical → `priority:critical`

If no Priority section exists, skip priority labeling.

#### Topic Labels (max 3)
Analyze the issue content (Description, Details, affected files) to classify by topic:
1. First, list existing `topic:*` labels: `gh label list --search "topic:" --json name --jq '.[].name'`
2. Match issue content against existing topics when possible
3. If a new topic is needed, create it: `gh label create "topic:<name>" --color "7057ff" --description "Related to <topic>"`
4. Add up to 3 topic labels total

### 2. SEARCH FOR RELATED CONTENT

### 3. UPDATE THE ISSUE BODY

### 4. SET PROJECT FIELDS (REQUIRED)
