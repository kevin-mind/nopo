Fix it.\n\n2. **Test coverage**: Find one test that is missing, incomplete, or could be improved. Enhance it.\n\n3. **Documentation**: Find one function, type, or module that lacks documentation or has outdated docs. Add or update the documentation.\n\nEach change should be minimal - the kind of thing you'd do in a quick code review pass. Keep scope XS per item.",
