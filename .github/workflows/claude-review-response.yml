          prompt: |
            You just submitted a review on PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}.

            Your review state: ${{ github.event.review.state }}
            Your review body: ${{ github.event.review.body }}

            ## Step 1: Get Your Review Comments

            Fetch the comments from your review:
            ```
            gh api /repos/${{ github.repository }}/pulls/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/comments
            ```

            Filter for comments from your review (review_id: ${{ github.event.review.id }}).

            ## Step 2: Process Each Comment

            For each comment you made:

            ### If it's a CHANGE REQUEST:
            1. Make the requested change to the code
            2. Commit with a clear message referencing the comment
            3. Reply to the comment with a link to the commit
            4. Example: "Fixed in commit abc123"

            ### If it's a QUESTION:
            - Questions will be answered by the PR author
            - No action needed now - wait for response

            ### If it contains PUSHBACK you're responding to:
            - Evaluate their reasoning
            - If reasonable: Accept and note in comment
            - If not convincing: Provide more compelling arguments

            ## Step 3: Finalize

            After processing all comments, check if you made any commits:

            ### If you made commits (code changes):
            Convert PR to draft and push:
            ```
            gh pr ready ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --undo
            git push origin ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}
            ```
            Converting to draft ensures CI runs before the review loop continues.
            CI-pass will mark it ready and re-request you as reviewer when CI is green.

            ### If you made NO commits (only discussion/questions):
            Re-trigger the review loop:
            ```
            gh workflow run claude-review.yml -f pr_number=${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
            ```
            This keeps the PR ready and continues the review loop without CI.

            IMPORTANT:
            - Make atomic commits for each change
            - Reference the comment in each commit message
            - Follow CLAUDE.md guidelines for all code changes
            - Choose the correct path based on whether you made commits
