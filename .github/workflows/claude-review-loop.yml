            You are reviewing PR #${{ needs.request-setup.outputs.pr_number }} on behalf of nopo-bot.

            nopo-bot was requested as a reviewer, which triggers this automated review.
            You (claude[bot]) will perform the actual review and submit it.

            ${{ needs.request-setup.outputs.has_issue == 'true' && format('## Linked Issue #{0}

            {1}

            ## Validation
            - CHECK ALL TODO ITEMS in the issue are addressed
            - VERIFY code follows CLAUDE.md guidelines
            - ENSURE tests cover the requirements

            ' }}
            ## Step 1: View the Changes

            You are already checked out on the PR branch. To see changes:
            ```bash
            git fetch origin main
            git diff origin/main...HEAD           # Full diff
            git diff origin/main...HEAD --stat    # Summary of changed files
            ```

            ## Step 2: Check Existing Review Comments

            Check for existing review comments using:
            ```bash
            gh pr view ${{ needs.request-setup.outputs.pr_number }} --comments
            ```

            For unresolved comment threads, decide if they should be resolved:
            - If the conversation is COMPLETE: Note it can be resolved
            - If changes were requested and made: Verify the fix
            - If more discussion needed: Leave unresolved

            ## Step 3: Review the Code

            Read the changed files and perform a thorough review:
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Potential bugs or edge cases
            - Test coverage adequacy
            - Security considerations

            ### CRITICAL: Edge Case Testing

            Don't just check if todos are addressed - verify the LOGIC is correct:

            1. **Trace through with examples**: Pick 2-3 realistic inputs and mentally
               trace the code path. For example:
               - What happens with empty input?
               - What happens with the most common case?
               - What happens at boundaries (first item, last item, max values)?

            2. **Test conflicting requirements**: If the feature has multiple options
               (e.g., flags, filters), what happens when they interact?

            3. **Run the code if possible**: Use the CLI or test commands to verify
               the feature actually works as intended, not just that it compiles.

            4. **Check for design flaws**: Does the implementation order of operations
               make sense? Are filters applied at the right time?

            If you find a logic bug, request changes with a specific example showing
            the incorrect behavior.

            ## Step 4: Submit Your Review

            Submit your review using `gh pr review ${{ needs.request-setup.outputs.pr_number }}` with ONE of:
            - `--approve` if ALL requirements met and code is good
            - `--request-changes -b "reason"` if changes are needed
            - `--comment -b "feedback"` if you have questions but no blocking issues

            IMPORTANT:
            - You may APPROVE but must NOT merge
            - A human will make the final merge decision

            You just submitted a review on PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}.

            Your review state: ${{ github.event.review.state }}
            Your review body: ${{ github.event.review.body }}

            ## Step 1: Get Your Review Comments

            Fetch the comments from your review:
            ```
            gh api /repos/${{ github.repository }}/pulls/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/comments
            ```

            Filter for comments from your review (review_id: ${{ github.event.review.id }}).

            ## Step 2: Process Each Comment

            For each comment you made:

            ### If it's a CHANGE REQUEST:
            1. Make the requested change to the code
            2. Commit with a clear message referencing the comment
            3. Reply to the comment noting the fix

            ### If it's a QUESTION:
            - Questions will be answered by the PR author
            - No action needed now - wait for response

            ## Step 3: Finalize

            After processing all comments, check if you made any commits:

            ### If you made commits (code changes):
            Push the changes:
            ```
            git push origin ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}
            ```
            The push will automatically convert PR to draft and trigger CI.
            CI-pass will mark it ready and re-request nopo-bot as reviewer when CI is green.

            ### If you made NO commits (only discussion/questions):
            Post a comment summarizing your analysis, then re-request nopo-bot as reviewer:
            ```
            gh pr comment ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --body "## Review Response Summary

            <your analysis of the review comments and what action was taken or why no action was needed>

            Re-requesting review to continue the loop."

            gh pr edit ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --add-reviewer "nopo-bot"
            ```

            IMPORTANT:
            - ALWAYS post a comment with your findings - never leave the PR without feedback
            - Make atomic commits for each change
            - Reference the comment in each commit message
            - Follow CLAUDE.md guidelines for all code changes

            Review state: ${{ github.event.review.state }}
            Review body: ${{ github.event.review.body }}

            ## Step 1: Get the Review Comments

            Fetch comments from this review:
            ```
            gh api /repos/${{ github.repository }}/pulls/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/comments
            ```

            Filter for comments from review_id: ${{ github.event.review.id }}

            ## Step 2: Process the Feedback

            **For CHANGES_REQUESTED reviews:**
            - Make each requested change to the code
            - Commit with a clear message referencing what was fixed
            - Reply to each comment noting the fix

            **For COMMENTED reviews (questions):**
            - Answer each question with a reply comment
            - If a question implies a needed change, make it

            ## Step 3: Finalize

            After processing all feedback:

            ### If you made commits (code changes):
            Push the changes:
            ```
            git push origin ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}
            ```
            The push will convert PR to draft and trigger CI.

            ### If you only answered questions (no commits):
            Post a summary comment, then re-request nopo-bot for the next review cycle:
            ```
            gh pr edit ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --add-reviewer "nopo-bot"
            ```

            IMPORTANT:
            - Address ALL feedback from the human reviewer
            - Make atomic commits for each change
            - Follow CLAUDE.md guidelines
          claude_args: '--model claude-opus-4-5-20251101 --max-turns 50'
        env:
