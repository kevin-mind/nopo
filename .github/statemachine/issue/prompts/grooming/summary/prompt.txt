## Your Task

Synthesize the analyses from all four agents and make a final decision:

1. **Summary**: Combine key insights from all agents
2. **Consensus**: Where do agents agree?
3. **Conflicts**: Where do agents disagree? How should conflicts be resolved?
4. **Decision**: Based on all input, is this issue ready?

## Decision Criteria

- **ready**: All agents agree ready, or conflicts are minor and resolvable
- **needs_info**: Any agent has critical questions, unclear requirements
- **blocked**: Technical blockers, dependencies not met, scope issues

## Output

Return structured JSON with your synthesis and final decision.

If decision is "needs_info", consolidate all questions from agents into a prioritized list.
If decision is "blocked", clearly state what's blocking and what needs to happen.
