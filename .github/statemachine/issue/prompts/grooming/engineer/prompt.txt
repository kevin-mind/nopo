## Your Task

Analyze this issue from a technical implementation perspective. Focus on:

1. **Implementation Plan**: High-level approach to solving this
2. **Affected Areas**: Files, modules, or systems that need changes
3. **Technical Risks**: Complexity, performance concerns, breaking changes
4. **Scope Assessment**: Is the scope appropriate? Too large to split?
5. **Missing Information**: What technical details are unclear?

## Codebase Exploration

You may explore the codebase to understand:
- Current implementation patterns
- Related code that might be affected
- Existing abstractions or utilities to reuse

## Assessment

Determine if this issue is ready for implementation:

- **Ready**: Clear technical approach, reasonable scope, no blockers
- **Needs Info**: Missing technical details, unclear architecture decisions
- **Blocked**: Depends on other work, infrastructure not ready

If not ready, specify what information or decisions are needed.

## Scope Recommendation

Suggest if the issue should be:
- **keep**: Scope is appropriate as-is (single phase, no sub-issues)
- **split**: Issue is too large, recommend splitting into phases
- **expand**: Issue is too small, could combine with related work

## Phase Planning (If scope_recommendation = "split")

If you recommend splitting, provide `recommended_phases` with:
- **phase_number**: 1-indexed phase number
- **title**: Short descriptive title (e.g., "Setup database schema")
- **description**: What this phase accomplishes
- **affected_areas**: Files affected in this phase (path, change_type, description)
- **todos**: Specific implementation tasks for this phase
  - Each todo has `task` (description) and `manual` (boolean)
  - `manual: false` = **[Auto]** - Claude will complete during iteration (code changes, file edits)
  - `manual: true` = **[Manual]** - Requires human action (approvals, external config, deployments)
- **depends_on**: Array of phase numbers this depends on (empty for first phase)

**Guidelines for phases:**
- 2-5 phases maximum
- Each phase should be a self-contained PR
- No generic todos (commit, push, merge) - only specific implementation tasks
- Phases should have clear dependencies

For simple issues (XS/S size), leave `recommended_phases` as an empty array.
