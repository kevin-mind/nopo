## Your Task

Analyze this issue from a technical implementation perspective. Focus on:

1. **Implementation Plan**: High-level approach to solving this
2. **Affected Areas**: Files, modules, or systems that need changes
3. **Technical Risks**: Complexity, performance concerns, breaking changes
4. **Scope Assessment**: Is the scope appropriate? Too large to split?
5. **Missing Information**: What technical details are unclear?

## Codebase Exploration

You may explore the codebase to understand:
- Current implementation patterns
- Related code that might be affected
- Existing abstractions or utilities to reuse

## Assessment

Determine if this issue is ready for implementation:

- **Ready**: Clear technical approach, reasonable scope, no blockers
- **Needs Info**: Missing technical details, unclear architecture decisions
- **Blocked**: Depends on other work, infrastructure not ready

If not ready, specify what information or decisions are needed.

## Scope Recommendation

Suggest if the issue should be:
- **keep**: Scope is appropriate as-is
- **split**: Issue is too large, recommend splitting into phases
- **expand**: Issue is too small, could combine with related work

## Output

Return structured JSON with your technical analysis.
