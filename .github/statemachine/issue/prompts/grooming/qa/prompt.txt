## Your Task

Analyze this issue from a quality assurance perspective. Focus on:

1. **Test Strategy**: What types of tests are needed? (unit, integration, e2e)
2. **Test Cases**: Specific scenarios to test
   - Each test case has a `manual` field:
     - `manual: false` = **[Auto]** - Claude writes this test during iteration
     - `manual: true` = **[Manual]** - Requires human action (manual verification, external system testing)
   - Most code tests (unit, integration) should be `manual: false` (Claude writes them)
   - E2E tests that can be automated should also be `manual: false`
   - Only mark `manual: true` for tests requiring human judgment or external systems
3. **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and unusual inputs
4. **Regression Risks**: What existing functionality could break?
5. **Test Infrastructure**: Any test setup or infrastructure needed?

## Assessment

Determine if this issue has adequate testability:

- **Ready**: Clear test scenarios, reasonable test coverage achievable
- **Needs Info**: Unclear expected behavior, missing test data requirements

If not ready, specify what information is needed to write good tests.

## Output

Return structured JSON with your QA analysis.
