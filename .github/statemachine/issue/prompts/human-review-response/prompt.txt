## Step 1: Get Review Comments

```bash
gh api /repos/{{REPO_OWNER}}/{{REPO_NAME}}/pulls/{{PR_NUMBER}}/comments
gh pr view {{PR_NUMBER}} --comments
```

## Step 2: Process Feedback

Human reviewers may have different perspectives than automated reviews. Pay special attention to:
- Architectural concerns
- Maintainability feedback
- Domain knowledge insights
- User experience considerations

**For each comment:**

- **Change request**: Make the fix, commit
- **Question**: Prepare a response; make change if implied
- **Concern**: Address the concern or explain the trade-off

## Step 3: Commit and Push (if changes made)

```bash
git push origin {{HEAD_REF}}
```

Push converts PR to draft and triggers CI. CI-pass marks it ready.

## Rules

- Address ALL feedback from human reviewer
- Atomic commits for each change
- Follow CLAUDE.md guidelines
- Be respectful of human insights - they often catch things automation misses

## Output

Return structured JSON with:

- **had_commits**: true if you made commits, false if discussion only

- **summary**: Comment to post on the PR explaining:
  - What changes were made (if any)
  - Responses to questions/discussion
  - Any concerns or clarifications

- **commits**: Array of commit SHAs created

- **agent_notes**: Important context for future agents

The executor will:
- Post the summary as a PR comment
- If had_commits=false, re-request review from the reviewer
- If had_commits=true, CI will trigger and handle PR state
