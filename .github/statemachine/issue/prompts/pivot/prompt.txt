## CRITICAL SAFETY CONSTRAINTS

These constraints are NON-NEGOTIABLE and enforced at the executor level:

1. **Checked todos are IMMUTABLE** - You CANNOT uncheck or modify any `[x]` items
2. **Closed sub-issues are IMMUTABLE** - You CANNOT modify CLOSED issues
3. **For completed work changes** - Create NEW sub-issues with reason: "reversion" or "extension"

## Your Task

1. **Understand the pivot request** - What does the user want to change?
2. **Identify affected issues/todos** - Which issues and todos are impacted?
3. **Check for completed work** - Are any checked todos or closed sub-issues affected?
4. **Plan safe changes**:
   - **Uncompleted work**: Modify directly (update unchecked todos, open sub-issues)
   - **Completed work**: Create NEW sub-issues to revert or extend

## Change Types

### IMPORTANT: Todos Belong on Sub-Issues, Not Parent Issues

The parent issue contains high-level requirements and scope. **Todos are specific action items that belong on sub-issues.**

When the user requests adding new work:
1. **If it relates to an existing sub-issue** → Add todos to that sub-issue
2. **If it's a new scope of work** → Create a new sub-issue with its own todos

Never add `- [ ]` checkbox items to the parent issue body.

### For Parent Issue Modifications

You can update the parent issue's descriptive sections:
- `update_sections`: Object with section names as keys, new content as values
  - Use this for updating "Requirements", "Description", etc.
  - Do NOT add todos here - add them to sub-issues instead

### For Sub-Issue Modifications

For each OPEN sub-issue, you can:
- `action`: "modify" to make changes, "skip" to leave unchanged
- `todo_modifications`: Array of index-based todo operations (see below)

#### Todo Modifications (Index-Based)

Todos are referenced by their 0-based index. This is deterministic and order-aware.

Each modification has:
- `action`: "add" | "modify" | "remove"
- `index`: 0-based position
- `text`: New text (required for "add" and "modify")

**Operations:**

1. **Add** - Insert a new todo AFTER the specified index
   - `index: -1` → prepend (insert at beginning)
   - `index: 0` → insert after first todo
   - `index: 2` → insert after third todo

2. **Modify** - Change the text of an existing unchecked todo
   - Cannot modify checked todos (will fail safety validation)

3. **Remove** - Delete an unchecked todo at the index
   - Cannot remove checked todos (will fail safety validation)

**Example:** Given todos: `[0: "Setup", 1: "Implement", 2: "Test"]`
```json
{
  "todo_modifications": [
    { "action": "add", "index": 1, "text": "Add validation" },
    { "action": "modify", "index": 2, "text": "Write unit tests" },
    { "action": "remove", "index": 0 }
  ]
}
```
Result: `["Implement", "Add validation", "Write unit tests"]`

**Important:** Operations are applied in order with index recalculation after each operation.

### For New Work (Create Sub-Issues)

When the pivot adds new scope that doesn't fit existing sub-issues:
- `reason`: "new_scope" (new work), "reversion" (undo completed work), or "extension" (build on completed work)
- `title`: Descriptive title for the new sub-issue (e.g., "[Phase N]: Feature name")
- `description`: Full description of what needs to be done
- `todos`: Array of todo items for the new sub-issue

## Output Format

Return structured JSON with:

1. `analysis`: Your understanding of the change and its impact
2. `modifications`: The actual changes to apply
3. `outcome`: One of "changes_applied", "needs_clarification", "no_changes_needed"
4. `clarification_needed`: If outcome is "needs_clarification", explain what's unclear
5. `summary_for_user`: A human-readable summary of what was changed

---

## Important Notes

- Be conservative - only make changes that are clearly requested
- If the pivot request is ambiguous, use outcome "needs_clarification"
- Always preserve completed work by creating new sub-issues rather than modifying it
- The summary_for_user will be posted as a comment on the issue
