You are analyzing a pivot request for issue #{{ISSUE_NUMBER}}: "{{ISSUE_TITLE}}"

## Pivot Request

{{PIVOT_DESCRIPTION}}

## Current State

### Parent Issue Body

{{ISSUE_BODY}}

### Sub-Issues

{{SUB_ISSUES_JSON}}

### Issue Comments

{{ISSUE_COMMENTS}}

## CRITICAL SAFETY CONSTRAINTS

These constraints are NON-NEGOTIABLE and enforced at the executor level:

1. **Checked todos are IMMUTABLE** - You CANNOT uncheck or modify any `[x]` items
2. **Closed sub-issues are IMMUTABLE** - You CANNOT modify CLOSED issues
3. **For completed work changes** - Create NEW sub-issues with reason: "reversion" or "extension"

## Your Task

1. **Understand the pivot request** - What does the user want to change?
2. **Identify affected issues/todos** - Which issues and todos are impacted?
3. **Check for completed work** - Are any checked todos or closed sub-issues affected?
4. **Plan safe changes**:
   - **Uncompleted work**: Modify directly (update unchecked todos, open sub-issues)
   - **Completed work**: Create NEW sub-issues to revert or extend

## Change Types

### For Parent Issue Modifications

You can update specific sections of the parent issue body:
- `update_sections`: Object with section names as keys, new content as values
- `add_todos`: New unchecked todos to add
- `remove_unchecked_todos`: Exact text of unchecked todos to remove (CANNOT remove checked todos)

### For Sub-Issue Modifications

For each OPEN sub-issue, you can:
- `action`: "modify" to make changes, "skip" to leave unchanged
- `add_todos`: New unchecked todos to add
- `remove_unchecked_todos`: Exact text of unchecked todos to remove

### For Completed Work Changes

If the pivot affects completed work, create new sub-issues:
- `reason`: "reversion" (undo completed work), "extension" (build on completed work), or "new_scope"
- `title`: Descriptive title for the new sub-issue
- `description`: Full description of what needs to be done
- `todos`: Array of todo items for the new sub-issue

## Output Format

Return structured JSON with:

1. `analysis`: Your understanding of the change and its impact
2. `modifications`: The actual changes to apply
3. `outcome`: One of "changes_applied", "needs_clarification", "no_changes_needed"
4. `clarification_needed`: If outcome is "needs_clarification", explain what's unclear
5. `summary_for_user`: A human-readable summary of what was changed

---

## Important Notes

- Be conservative - only make changes that are clearly requested
- If the pivot request is ambiguous, use outcome "needs_clarification"
- Always preserve completed work by creating new sub-issues rather than modifying it
- The summary_for_user will be posted as a comment on the issue
