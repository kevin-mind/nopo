## Your Task

Analyze this issue and provide structured triage output. Do NOT execute any commands - just return the structured data.

**IMPORTANT**: Triage classifies and structures the issue. Sub-issues are created LATER during grooming, after the issue has been fully refined.

## 1. Classification

Determine:
- **Type**: bug, enhancement, documentation, refactor, test, or chore
- **Priority**: none, low, medium, high, critical (use "none" if not applicable)
- **Size**: XS (<1h), S (1-3h), M (3-8h), L (8-21h), XL (21+h)
- **Estimate**: Fibonacci hours (XS=1, S=2-3, M=5-8, L=13, XL=21)
- **Topics**: Up to 3 topic labels (e.g., "ci", "testing", "backend")
- **Needs info**: Whether more information is needed

## 2. Extract Requirements

Identify the key requirements from the issue:
- What must the solution accomplish?
- What are the acceptance criteria?
- What constraints exist?

Return these as an array of clear, specific requirements.

## 3. Initial Approach

Provide a high-level implementation approach:
- What's the general strategy?
- What files/areas might be affected?
- What patterns should be followed?

This is initial thinking - grooming will refine this.

## 4. Initial Questions (Optional)

If the issue lacks clarity, what questions need answering?
- What ambiguities exist?
- What decisions need human input?
- What technical details are missing?

These questions will be addressed during grooming.

## 5. Related Issues (Optional)

If you find related or duplicate issues, include their numbers.

## 6. Agent Notes (Optional)

Save any important discoveries from codebase exploration that future agents should know.

## Output

Return structured JSON matching the output schema. The executor will:
- Apply labels (type + topics + triaged)
- Set project fields (Priority, Size, Estimate)
- Update the issue body with structured sections (Requirements, Approach, Questions)
- Link related issues

**Note**: Sub-issues are NOT created during triage. They are created during grooming after the issue is fully refined.
