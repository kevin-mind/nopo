## Instructions

This is iteration {{ITERATION}}. Make **incremental progress** - do NOT try to complete everything at once.

### 1. Assess Current State

```bash
git status && git log --oneline -3
```

Check which todos are done vs pending.

### 1.5. Check for Conflicts with Main

**Before doing any work**, check if your branch has conflicts with main:

```bash
git fetch origin main
git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/main HEAD && echo "Up to date" || echo "Behind main"
```

**If behind main**, try to rebase:

```bash
git rebase origin/main
```

**If rebase fails with conflicts**:
1. Check the conflict severity: `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U`
2. If conflicts are in files YOU modified, try to resolve them
3. If conflicts are in files you didn't touch or are too complex:
   - Abort the rebase: `git rebase --abort`
   - Set status to `blocked` with `blocked_reason: "Merge conflicts with main that require human intervention. Conflicting files: [list them]"`
   - **Do NOT waste iterations on unresolvable conflicts**

**Simple conflicts** (your changes + main changes in different parts of same file):
- Resolve by keeping both changes appropriately
- `git add <file>` and `git rebase --continue`

**Complex conflicts** (overlapping changes, structural refactors, deleted files):
- These need human judgment - set status to `blocked` immediately

### 2. Determine Action

**If CI failed** (`LAST_CI_RESULT = failure`):
- Run `make check && make test` to reproduce locally
- Fix the issues, verify, commit

**If CI passed or first iteration**:
- Find the **next unchecked todo** (one without `[x]`)
- Check if the code already satisfies this todo
- If YES: Return `status: "completed_todo"` with the todo text - the executor will check it off
- If NO: Implement the todo, then return `status: "completed_todo"`
- Complete **just ONE todo per iteration**

**If next unchecked todo has `[Manual]` prefix**:
- These require human action (testing, verification, etc.)
- **EXIT IMMEDIATELY** - do not attempt to complete it
- Set status to `waiting_manual` with the todo text in `manual_todo`
- A human will complete the task, check it off, and re-trigger the workflow

**If all non-manual todos are checked off and CI passed**:
- Set status to `all_done`
- Workflow handles marking PR ready and requesting review

**IMPORTANT**: Each iteration should check off exactly ONE todo. Even if multiple todos are already satisfied by existing code, only return ONE `todo_completed` per iteration. The workflow will re-run to check off the next one.

### 3. Implementation

1. Read files before editing
2. Follow CLAUDE.md guidelines
3. Keep changes small and focused

### 4. Verify Before Committing

```bash
make check && make test
```

**STOP if any command fails.** Fix before committing.

### 5. Commit and Push

Commit with descriptive message, push to origin. Workflow handles the rest.

### 6. Create PR (First Iteration Only)

If no PR exists:
{{PR_CREATE_COMMAND}}

## Output

Return structured JSON with:

- **status**: What happened this iteration
  - `completed_todo` - A todo item is satisfied (code exists OR you just implemented it)
  - `waiting_manual` - Next unchecked todo has `[Manual]` prefix
  - `blocked` - Cannot proceed (explain in blocked_reason)
  - `all_done` - All non-manual todos are checked off, ready for review

- **todo_completed**: The **exact text** of ONE todo that is now satisfied (if status=completed_todo)
  - Copy the todo text EXACTLY as it appears in the issue (without the `- [ ]` prefix)
  - Example: "Add login form validation"
  - The executor will check this off in the issue body
  - **Always use this status** when there's an unchecked todo that the code satisfies

- **manual_todo**: The **exact text** of the manual todo (if status=waiting_manual)
  - Only use this when the NEXT unchecked todo has `[Manual]` prefix

- **blocked_reason**: Explanation if status=blocked

- **agent_notes**: Important discoveries for future iterations (stored in history)

The executor will:
- Check off the todo_completed in the issue body (matches fuzzy, so slight differences OK)
- Store agent_notes in iteration history
- Handle PR ready state transitions based on status
