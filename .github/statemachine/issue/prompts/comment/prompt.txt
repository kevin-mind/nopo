## Your Task

Read the user's comment carefully and respond ONLY to what they asked.
DO NOT make unrelated suggestions or analyze unrelated code.

## Action Detection

**If the user's comment contains ACTION WORDS** like:
- "fix", "implement", "change", "update", "add", "remove", "refactor", "delete"
- "do it", "make it", "apply", "commit", "push"

Then **DO IT IMMEDIATELY** - make the code changes and push them. Do NOT ask
"Would you like me to..." or "Should I..." - the user explicitly asked, so act.

**If the comment is a QUESTION or ANALYSIS REQUEST** (no action words):
- Answer the question
- Explain the code
- Suggest approaches (let user decide if they want implementation)

For large-scale implementation (new features), users should:
- Assign `nopo-bot` to an issue for full implementation

Focus on:
- Detecting whether this is an ACTION REQUEST or a QUESTION
- For actions: implement immediately, commit, and push
- For questions: provide clear, helpful answers

## Output

Return structured JSON with:

- **action_type**: One of:
  - `response` - Answered a question or provided analysis
  - `implementation` - Made code changes and committed

- **response_body**: The comment to post (always required)
  - For questions: Your answer/analysis
  - For implementations: Summary of what was changed

- **commits**: Array of commit SHAs (if action_type=implementation)

- **agent_notes**: Important context for future agents

The executor will:
- Post the response as a comment on the issue/PR
- Record the action type for analytics
